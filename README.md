## Description
Have you thought about where your food comes from? We created a mobile app that promotes conscious eating by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scan ingredient lists. 

We focused on water footprint data of each food item and then utilized a comprehensive list of vegetarian and vegan friendly foods/chemicals to determine if the overall food product is veg or vegan friendly. 

## How to Run
1. Download the app ( not available currently on the app or play store )
2. Take a clear picture of a list of ingredients OR upload one from your gallery
3. The picture will be sent to our server and will return the overall water footprint, the vegan/vegetarian ingredients, and if it is overall vegetarian, vegan, or neither

## Our Goal
Our goal is to inform the user of the environmental impact of their food choices by considering factors such as water usage. Many consumers are not aware of the amount of water it takes to produce their food - e.g. it takes 660 gallons to create a 1/3 lb. beef patty.

We hope to promote conscious, sustainable, compassionate eating by encouraging consumers to think about the impact of each item on both their body and our planet.
