# Mind Your Food 
__ A mobile app that utilizes OCR to inform the user about the water footprint and veg-friendliness of a food item.

## Description
Have you thought about where your food comes from? We created a mobile app that promotes conscious eating by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scan ingredient lists. 

We focused on water footprint data of each food item and then utilized a comprehensive list of vegetarian and vegan friendly foods/chemicals to determine if the overall food product is veg or vegan friendly. 

## Our Goal
Our goal is to inform the user of the environmental impact of their food choices by considering factors such as water usage. 

We hope to promote conscious, compassionate eating by encouraging consumers to think about the impact of each item on both their body and the planet.
